# Walkies Testing


Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.


To ensure that Walkies works effectively over a number of sites and devices, I have prepared details and screenshots for you to see the testing I have done to ensure it is very reliable..




## Code Validation




HTML Validation


I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.


Below is a link for you too see live that my code is valid plus I have enclosed a screenshot in case for some reason that fails;

Error

### Browser capability


I have tested Walkies on four different browsers. The first was chrome, the second was Firefox, the third was Brave and the fourth was Opera. 

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download) 
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download) 


I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues. To ensure that all are working correctly I have also tested for responsiveness on desktop, tablet and mobile

### Lighthouse Audit


I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. I have enclosed the following screenshots to show as my evidence.

## Bugs

Unfortunately due to the way the training has been structured I didnt realise I was expected to be cataloguing the errors that had come up. It was only made aware to me by my mentor once I had completed my site. I will ensure that in the future I am cataloguing as I go so that for future projects you can see these.
