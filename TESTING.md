# Walkies Testing


Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.


To ensure that Walkies works effectively over a number of sites and devices, I have prepared details and screenshots for you to see the testing I have done to ensure it is very reliable..




## Code Validation




HTML Validation


I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.


Below is a link for you too see live that my code is valid plus I have enclosed a screenshot in case for some reason that fails;




| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FPimmz.github.io%2FProject-1%2Findex.html) ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/W3validator-homescreen.jpg)|

### CSS Validation


Below is a link for you too see live that my code is valid plus I have enclosed a screenshot in case for some reason that fails;

Error
[screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/css-error.jpg) px was missing on line 288 and 292, now fixed






### Browser capability and Responsiveness


I have tested Walkies on three different browsers. The first was chrome, the second was Firefox and the third was Safari


- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)


- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)


- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)




I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues. To ensure that all are working correctly I have also tested for responsiveness on desktop, tablet and mobile


| Browser | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome Desktop| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/chrome-desktop.jpg) | Works as expected |
| Chrome Tablet| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/chrome-tablet.jpg) | Works as expected |
| Chrome Mobile ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/chrome-mobile.jpg) | Works as expected |


| Firefox Desktop| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/firefox-desktop.jpg) | Works as expected |
| Firefox Tablet| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/firefox-tablet.jpg) | Works as expected |
| Firefox Mobile| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/firefox-mobile.jpg) | Works as expected |


| Safari Desktop| Unfortunately I do not have access to a apple desktop computer to check this. I have checked the tablet and mobile through devtools
| Safari tablet| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/ipadair.jpg) | Works as expected |
| Safari Mobile| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/iphonese.jpg) | Works as expected |


To be completely thorough I have tested Walkies on the below devices.


| Device | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ipad mini | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/ipadmini.jpg) | Works as expected |
| iphone 12 pro | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/iphone12pro.jpg) | Works as expected |
| iphone xr | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/iphonexr.jpg) | Works as expected |
| Nest hub| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/nesthub.jpg) | Works as expected |
| Nest hub Max| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/nesthubmax.jpg) | Works as expected |
| Pixel 5 | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/pixel5.jpg) | Works as expected |
| Surface duo | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/surfaceduo.jpg) | Works as expected |

| Galaxy S20 Ultra | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/galaxys20ultra.jpg) | Works as expected |




### Lighthouse Audit


I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. I have enclosed the following screenshots to show as my evidence.


| Page | Size | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/documentation/lighthouse-home-mobile.jpg) | | Slow performance due to not having a effective cache policy

## Bugs


Unfortunately due to the way the training has been structured I didnt realise I was expected to be cataloguing the errors that had come up. It was only made aware to me by my mentor once I had completed my site. I will ensure that in the future I am cataloguing as I go so that for future projects you can see these.
