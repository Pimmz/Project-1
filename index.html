            <h3>Benefit of dog walking</h3>
            <p>Improved cardiovascular fitness, lower blood pressure, stronger muscles and bones (built up by walking regularly), and decreased stress. A regular walk is vitally important for your pet's health too.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How long should a walk be?</h3>
            <p>While 45 minutes or more is ideal, a 30- minute walk is usually an achievable goal for most dog owners and will help to keep your dog fit and well balanced</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What happens if you dont walk your dog</h3>
            <p>Dogs need regular exercise, just like people. If your dog isn't getting enough physical activity, he may put on too much weight, become bored or frustrated, or release his pent-up energy in undesirable ways. Keep in mind that individual dogs have different needs.</p>
