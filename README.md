Walkies

Welcome to Walkies! The dog walking and boarding website created to ensure dogs get the excercise and comfort they so richly deserve.
I have created Walkies as we have a great love for dogs and have a Wired Haired Fox Terrier ourselves that we have regularly walked and trained and have found that so many dogs dont get the excercise they need due to us all having such busy lives.

My Fiance is also a big influence in me building Walkies as she has always talked about changing her job that she dosnet enjoy and often talks about how fun it would be to be able to walk dogs dogs for a living. So now this will give her the opprtunity to start her business digitly which will help to build up her client base. 

Walkies has been designed so dogs of all breads can get that energy out of their bodies that can have such a distruptive behaviour around the house. It is our ultimate goal to ensure that as many dogs as possible have calm and relaxing lives, rather than being frustartaed and angry due to the lack of excercise. not to mention the improved cardiovascular fitness, lower blood pressure, stronger muscles and bones (built up by walking regularly), and decreased stress. A regular walk is vitally important for your dogs health.

Heres a screenshot of the website for to see from amiresponsive [screenshot](documentation/walkies.jpg)


Design Process

When I started the design of Walkies I wanted to ensure the site was Useful, Useable and Valuable, so that it makes the user experience informative and enjoyable. To do this I looked at the five key fundamentals;
                            
Stragety - To ensure dogs get the excercise and comfort they so richly deserve when their owners are able to do so themselves.

Scope - Based on the information from the stategy the features included emotive images, key information as to the benefits of walking your dog. The services provided by Walkies and the cost. How to contact us and the location we currently serve. A way to feedback the customers experience to help us to constantly improve. A review section for google reviews left by others customers to help clarify the excellent service offered by Walkies. A consistent nav bar and footer was also required to ensure existencecy across every web page to help the user navigate easily around the site.

Structure - This was designed around the customer path. After speaking with a number of the general public, they wanted to know what we did?, the services we provided?, the cost of it? and what other customers had thought of the service. 

Skeleton - As before this was designed around the customer path which was gained through the general public. This dictated that the pages would follow the first Home screen showing the what we did?, the second showing the services and the price we charged, the third showing how to get in contact with us and provide feedback to help us constantly improve. The fouth page is to show what other customers are saying to help them make an informed response.

Surface - I wanted the look of Walkies to be informative, clear, concise, with consistent typography and coresponding colours to help them stand out, to easily navigated with emotive pictures that helped to bring an element of fun which I believe all of our dogs give us on a daily basis.

Then I sat down and roughly sketched out onto paper what the screens would look like in a desktop, mobile and tablet look 
[screenshot](documentation/Initial-paper-design.jpg) [screenshot](documentation/Intial-paper-design1.jpg) This then gave me the basis to start creating Walkies in gitpod.


Walkies choice of colour

#fff4f3 was used for primary text.
rgb(0,0,0,0.9) was used for primary highlights on the Navigation bar and footer
#dfdfdf was used as a secondary highlight to help text stand out 
#B6DCDF was used to highlight the sevices text.

To help with the colour choice I used coolors https://coolors.co/generate it allowed me to put the home image in and it generated the colours used. screenshot attached

Typography

I looked for font on google fonts, to help me decide as it gave a better visual aid for me to see how they all looked in there different weights. After many hours trying the fonts out on Walkies I decide to keep pt serif all the way through to ensure a good balance, with a conssitent look and feel. As a back up I used oswald as it has a great look and then my third choice was sans-serif as a fall back incase the other two werent available.

[pt serif]https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif?query=pt+serif was used for the all the text and headers.



Icons

To help with making Walkies as user friendly as possible I used icons from font awesome. This helped highlight specific areas to bring the user attention to it.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.



Features

The following features were included on the website to ensure it was as user friendly as possible;

- A consistent, clear, concise navigation bar and footer was also required to ensure existency across every web page to help the user navigate easily around the site,    
  understand abit about us, see our location and view our social media.

- Emotive images were used to help people to relate them to our business of walking their dog
  [screenshot](documentation/colour-scheme.jpg)


- Benefits of walking your dog were also used to help show the real positives of regualar excercise and how vitel it is to their dogs health.
  [screenshot](documentation/colour-scheme.jpg)


- The services provided by Walkies and the cost are a key part to aid customers see what service we offer and the price of them.
  [screenshot](documentation/services-page.jpg)


- How to contact us and the location we currently serve is one of the most important pieces of information, so that the customer knows exactly how to get hold of us 
  and whether or not we serve their particular area. To aid with this our address and telephone number are on the footer of every page.
  [screenshot](documentation/contact-page.jpg)


- As constantly improving is a must for any business, I have included a feedback form for customers to provide us with information that can help improve our business, 
  regardless of whether or not they are a 
  customer. 
  [screenshot](documentation/contact-page.jpg)


- A review section for google reviews has also been created to show reviews left by others customers to help clarify the excellent service offered by Walkies. As more  
  and more purchases are often made by the 
  reviews of other customers.

Future Features

Navigation bar
I would love to change the navigation bar buttons in dog bones, which made a woofing sound when pressed. Just to add alittle more design and fun to the page 

Google review
I would like to add a seperate link where customers can leave a google review direct from the site. Reviews are essential for a business to help them move forward so to be able to capture the customer early would be a great addition to the site

Interactive Map
In the contact pages I would love to be able to change the existing static map to an interactive one with street view capabilites. Just to add abit more technology to the page. 

Using Flexfrog rather than css floats.
Due to the way the course is structured Id learnt how to use css floats to a degree with the love running project. I was finding it difficult to move boxes around in css floats and during my mentor meeting he mention using flexfrog and gave me the link to use it. But as time was a factor and I had learnt css floats I continued using it. But look forward to using flexfrog.

Mobile first Approach
Due to the way the course is structured Id learnt how to use css floats when it came to responsive design with the love running project. Again in the meeting with my mentor he mentioned the benefit of mobile first, as some many of us use our mobiles now to search the internet and it was a smarter way of building a website. So I look forward to designing my next website using that approach.

Video / Picture Gallery
I would like to add another page that showed " with owners concent " their dogs running around enjoying themselves in a video and picture gallery so it engaged the customer better. So they knew what their dog could be doing to.

Commit messages.
I'm fully aware that my original commits were done incorrectly, due to the fact that I was following the method taught by the Code Institute videos. However, after having my first call with my mentor, we discussed the appropriate method to write the commit messages, and I have since changed this behaviour. The screenshot below shows the first commits that were done incorrectly.
